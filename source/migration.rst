For this section  of the documentation we have split the content into two
parts. One is for users who are looking to migrate to the cloud for the first
time and have limited experience with how a cloud platform works. For these
users, the following explain several different stratagies to consider when
wanting to migrate to the Catalyst Cloud.

   migration-strategy-guide/cloud-native-redesign

The second part of this documentation includes a number of exampls on how to
migrate existing resources to your catalyst cloud project. These are useful for
users who have had experience working with cloud platforms in the past and are
wanting to move their current infrastructure set up, over to the Catalyst
Cloud.
